# When using LicenseScout with Omnibus, LicenseScout is run from the bundled
# omnibus process which has a different ruby executable and rubygems directory
# than the project we want to collect licenses for. Bundler will end up loading
# the gemspecs for the gems we are inspecting, so we need to run our query for
# version and license information from a separate process that executes inside
# the target ruby+bundler environment. This script is the thing that runs that
# query; it's intended to be run like
# `/opt/chef/embedded/bin/ruby /path/to/script`. It returns the data
# LicenseScout needs as JSON on stdout.

# We need to load the target project's bundler config, so we have to do a full
# bundler setup:
require "bundler/setup"

# We're only using things that are in the stdlib.
